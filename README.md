The following is a list and description of all files read-in to build out required tidy data set.
The dataset spanned various files that included seperate:
test data - all featureset data assigned to test set

             as test and training data.
training label - same as test label  but corresponding to training data set
test subject - single vector for numeric identifier of subject for test set. In same order as 
                  corresponding training data set
training subject - single vector for numeric identifier of subject for training set set. In same order as 
                  corresponding training data set
