Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals time.accelerometer-(XYZ) and 
time.gyroscope-(XYZ). These time domain signals (prefix 'time.') were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using
a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration
signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals - (time.body.accelerometer-(XYZ) and time.gravity.accelerometer-(XYZ) 
using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
(time.body.accelerometer.jerk-XYZ and time.body.gyroscope.jerk-(XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were 
calculated using the Euclidean norm (time.body.accelerometer.magnitude, time.gravity.accelerometer.magnitude,
time.body.accelerometer.jerk.magnitude, time.body.gyroscope.magnitude-, time.body.gyroscope.jerk.magnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequency.body.accelerometer.(xyz).axis,
frequency.body.accelerometer.jerk-(xyz).axis, frequency.body.gyroscope.-(xyz).axis,frequency.body.accelerometer.jerk.Mag, 
frequency.body.gyroscope.magnitude, frequency.body.gyroscope.jerk.magnitude. 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-(xyz).axis' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

================================================================================================================================
Important Note : the measurements of the data base are the mean values for the following grouping combination - 
each activity type & each subject of the experiment. Where activity names is the activity of the subject - laying, standing, etc.
The subject is the numerical identifier for the expirementee under observation. Each variable, except for activity.name and subject is an average 
of all observations including mean and standard deviation 
===========================================================================================================================

There are a total of 88 variables... The following represent only core variable names, so that each suffix, e.g, mean, standard deviation,
x-axis, y-axis, & z-axis, creates an additional combination.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
standard_deviation(): Standard deviation
angle_between(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle_between() variable:

gravity.mean
time.body.accelerometer.mean
time.body.accelerometer.jerk.mean tBodyAccJerkMean
time.body.gyroscope.mean
time.body.gyroscope.jerk.meant
